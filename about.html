          I am passionate about software development. My interest lies in
          developing large-scale SaaS applications using Javascript,
          Typescript and React. When developing, I put special emphasis on
          responsive design, clean code and an excellent user experience. In
          collaboration, I value agile methods very much. Because continuous
          learning is also very important to me, I would like to further
          expand my programming skills with respect to back-end technologies
          in the future.
